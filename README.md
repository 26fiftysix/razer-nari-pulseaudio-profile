# SteelSeries Arctis 5 pulseaudio profile

The SteelSeries Arctis 5 is a gaming headset which has two stereo audio outputs. One for voice chat and one for the rest of the sound. It can be mixed between with a physical knob.

By default, pulseaudio only enables the voice chat output. This profile enables the second (game) output and the udev rule makes sure this profile is used when plugging in the device.
